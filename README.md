- 👋 Hi, I’m @underandwaterthings
- 👀 I’m interested in molecular and micro- biology and arduino...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning 3D modeling so that I can better take advantage of my 3D printer...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anythings that catches my fancy, but I’m probably not really ready to contribute much yet...
- 📫 How to reach me, probably best use github...
